# Overview Section

Use this section to orient new contributors. Keep the content non-technical but actionable, linking to deeper pages when needed.

## Pages To Maintain
- `project_overview.md` – One-page summary of FUEL, key capabilities, ROS 2 status.
- `architecture.md` – High-level diagrams + narrative for planner, simulator, and sensing stacks.
- `roadmap.md` – Quarter-by-quarter goals, milestones, and ownership.

Update the `roadmap.md` whenever `docs/porting/PORTING_PROGRESS.md` dates change so the narrative stays aligned with the tracker.
