# Architecture Overview

_Add diagrams (PNG/SVG under `files/`) and describe how the planner, simulator, sensing, and visualization stacks interact._

## Suggested Sections
1. System context diagram (planner ↔ simulator ↔ sensing).
2. Data flow: messages/topics across `plan_manage`, `poly_traj`, `so3_control`, `local_sensing`.
3. Deployment topology (dev container, onboard computer, ground station).
