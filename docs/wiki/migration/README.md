# Migration Section

Centralize the ROS 1→2 strategy here so engineers do not have to dig through scattered notes.

## Key Files
- `ros1_to_ros2_checklist.md` – end-to-end checklist spanning manifests, nodes, launch files, and tests.
- `api_changes.md` – catalog of API differences (logging, parameters, TF, node composition).
- `porting_playbook.md` – step-by-step guide with code snippets.
- `../porting/PORTING_PROGRESS.md` – authoritative status table (link rather than copy).

Whenever a package is fully ported, update both the checklist and the progress tracker.
