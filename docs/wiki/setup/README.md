# Setup Section

Capture everything needed to reproduce the dev environment locally or in CI.

## Required Pages
- `dev_container.md` – how to open the dev container, source ROS, and common pitfalls.
- `build_pipeline.md` – canonical `colcon` commands, lint hooks, CI expectations.
- `simulator_launch.md` – launching the UAV simulator + planners end-to-end.

Feel free to add scenario-specific guides (e.g., hardware bring-up) as their own Markdown files and link them here.
